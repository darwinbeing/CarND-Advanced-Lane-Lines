### Introduction

In this project, we will build a pipeline using distortion correction, image rectification, color transforms, and gradient thresholding to identify lane lines and their curvature in a video.


The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

### Camera Calibration


The code for this step is contained in the file camera_calibration.py, the functions can load a calculated camera matrix and distortion coefficients from a pickle file or calculate and store.

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

### Pipeline

**Original images**

The test images have the shape (720, 1280, 3), meaning a height of 720, a width of 1280, and 3 RGB channels.

#### Distortion-corrected images.

To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to the test images like these:

#### Combined thresholds


I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image, the selection for pixels where both the x and y gradients meet the threshold criteria, or the gradient magnitude and direction are both within their threshold values.

For HLS and color thresholds, the S channel is doing a fairly robust job of picking up the lines under very different color and contrast conditions, the R channel does rather well on the white lines.

```python
    gradx = abs_sobel_thresh(undistorted, orient='x', sobel_kernel=ksize, thresh=(20, 100))
    grady = abs_sobel_thresh(undistorted, orient='y', sobel_kernel=ksize, thresh=(20, 100))
    mag_binary = mag_thresh(undistorted, sobel_kernel=ksize, thresh=(30, 100))
    dir_binary = dir_threshold(undistorted, sobel_kernel=ksize, thresh=(0.7, 1.3))

    combined_binary = np.zeros_like(dir_binary)
    combined_binary[(color_binary == 1) | ((gradx == 1) & (grady == 1)) \
                    | ((mag_binary == 1) & (dir_binary == 1))] = 1
```
Here's an example of my output for this step.

#### Perspective transform.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warper()`, The `warper()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:

```python
    src = np.float32([[(200, 720), (453, 547), (835, 547), (1100, 720)]])
    dst = np.float32([[(320, 720), (320, 590), (960, 590), (960, 720)]])
```

This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| 200, 720      | 320, 720        |
| 453, 547      | 320, 590      |
| 835, 547     | 960, 590      |
| 1100, 720      | 960, 720        |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

#### Identify lane line

I use sliding windows to find line pixels, once we get a fit, in the next frame of video we can just search in a margin around the previous line position.

Then I used their x and y pixel positions to fit a second order polynomial curve

#### Calculated the radius of curvature

In order to find the curvature, found left and right line pixels are scaled w.r.t. real world metrics. Then fitted second order polynomials are calculated using numpy.polyfit on the scaled points and fed into the formula presented in the course.

Then we actually need to repeat this calculation after converting our x and y values to real world space.

I did this in my code in `pipeline.py`

```python
# Define conversions in x and y from pixels space to meters
ym_per_pix = 30/720 # meters per pixel in y dimension
xm_per_pix = 3.7/700 # meters per pixel in x dimension

# Fit new polynomials to x,y in world space
left_fit_cr = np.polyfit(ploty*ym_per_pix, leftx*xm_per_pix, 2)
right_fit_cr = np.polyfit(ploty*ym_per_pix, rightx*xm_per_pix, 2)
# Calculate the new radii of curvature
left_curverad = ((1 + (2*left_fit_cr[0]*y_eval*ym_per_pix + left_fit_cr[1])**2)**1.5) / np.absolute(2*left_fit_cr[0])
right_curverad = ((1 + (2*right_fit_cr[0]*y_eval*ym_per_pix + right_fit_cr[1])**2)**1.5) / np.absolute(2*right_fit_cr[0])
# Now our radius of curvature is in meters
print(left_curverad, 'm', right_curverad, 'm')
# Example values: 632.1 m    626.2 m
```

#### Pipeline result

I implemented this step in my code in `pipeline.py` in the function `pipeline()`.  Here is an example of my result on test images:

### Discussion


* Select better masking algorithm to get the yellow and white lane lines involves a simple rgb threshold for the white lane lines and a hsv threshold for the yellow lane lines
path planning, and control.
* Perspective transformation works well, try my best to optimize src / destination points.
